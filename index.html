            <p><strong>Quick Site Launcher</strong> is a streamlined Chrome extension designed for rapid access to your favorite websites using intuitive keyboard shortcuts.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lightning-Fast Navigation:</strong> Open your most visited sites with a simple keyboard command (e.g., Ctrl+M by default, then a single key for your site).</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable Shortcuts:</strong> Easily define, edit, and manage shortcuts to any URL through the extension's options page.</li>
                <li><strong>Popup Interface:</strong> A clean and simple popup displays your configured shortcuts for quick reference.</li>
                <li><strong>Open in Current or New Tab:</strong> Choose to open sites in your current tab or a new tab (using Ctrl + key).</li>
                <li><strong>Manifest V3 Compatible:</strong> Built with the latest Chrome extension platform standards for improved security, performance, and privacy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>This extension is heavily inspired by the original <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sitelauncher-startup-edit/kpkjomcemjimkbmhiobdobpiocgnkgoc?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteLauncher Startup Edition</a>. While the original was a fantastic tool, it was based on the older Manifest V2. Quick Site Launcher aims to provide a similar, beloved functionality while being fully compatible with Manifest V3, ensuring it continues to work smoothly with modern Chrome browsers.</p>

            <h2>Why Manifest V3?</h2>
            <p>Manifest V3 is the newer standard for Chrome extensions, focusing on enhancing security, privacy, and performance. By building Quick Site Launcher on Manifest V3, we ensure it's future-proof and adheres to Google's latest guidelines for a safer browsing experience.</p>
