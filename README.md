# Quick Site Launcher
This is a quick and simple site launcher extension, designed with hot keys in mind.
Assign a hotkey to the extension, then assign any url you wish to a specific key (mostly the letters, but numbers should work too)
E.g. Ctrl+m, c to go to https://chatgpt.com
Shortcuts are definable in the extensions options
